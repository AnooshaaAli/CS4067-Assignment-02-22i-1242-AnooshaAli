# User Service - FastAPI Microservice  

This is the **User Service** for the Event Booking System, built using **FastAPI** with **PostgreSQL** as the database and **REST API** for communication.

## üìÇ Project Setup  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up Virtual Environment**  
To keep dependencies isolated, we use a virtual environment.  

#### ‚û§ **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**  
**Windows:**  
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```  
**Mac/Linux:**  
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```  

---

If you ever want to deactivate the virtual env, use these commands in the folder/dictory you crearted the virtaul env:

#### **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**  
If it's currently activated, run:  
```sh
deactivate
```

#### **Delete the Virtual Environment Folder**  
Find the virtual environment folder (likely named `venv` or `.venv`) in the root of your repository and delete it manually, or run:  
```sh
rm -rf venv  # Mac/Linux
rmdir /s /q venv  # Windows (PowerShell)
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
```  

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Generate `requirements.txt`**  
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```  
This allows others to install the same dependencies by running:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

---

No problem! The `requirements.txt` file is used to keep track of dependencies, but it won't exist until you create it. Here's how to fix everything:  

---

### **üìå Fixing the Virtual Environment & Dependencies**
Now that you have the virtual environment inside `user-service`, let's set up dependencies properly.

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Activate the Virtual Environment**  
Make sure you're inside `user-service` and activate it:  

For **Mac/Linux**:
```sh
source venv/bin/activate
```
For **Windows**:
```sh
venv\Scripts\activate
```

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Required Packages**  
Since you're using **FastAPI** and **PostgreSQL**, install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn psycopg2 sqlalchemy
```

- `fastapi` ‚Üí The framework  
- `uvicorn` ‚Üí ASGI server to run FastAPI  
- `psycopg2` ‚Üí PostgreSQL driver  
- `sqlalchemy` ‚Üí ORM to interact with PostgreSQL  

---

#### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a `requirements.txt` File**  
After installing the dependencies, **generate a `requirements.txt` file** so others can install the same dependencies easily:

```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Now, your project has all the necessary packages documented.

---

#### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Everything Works**  
Try running a basic FastAPI server to check that everything is set up correctly:


Then, run the server:

```sh
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

If you see output like this:

```
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

You‚Äôre good to go! üéâ You can visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) in your browser to see the API.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**  
- **DO NOT commit the `venv/` folder**.  
- Add `venv/` to `.gitignore`.  
- Commit & push `requirements.txt` to GitHub.
