## 📂 Project Setup  

### 1️⃣ **Set Up Virtual Environment**  
To keep dependencies isolated, we use a virtual environment.  

#### ➤ **Create and Activate Virtual Environment**  
**Windows:**  
```sh
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```  
**Mac/Linux:**  
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```  

If you ever want to deactivate the virtual env, use these commands in the folder/dictory you crearted the virtaul env:

### **1️⃣ Delete the Virtual Environment**  
Since you created it in the whole repo, first **deactivate** and **delete** it.

#### **Deactivate the Virtual Environment**  
If it's currently activated, run:  
```sh
deactivate
```

#### **Delete the Virtual Environment Folder**  
Find the virtual environment folder (likely named `venv` or `.venv`) in the root of your repository and delete it manually, or run:  
```sh
rm -rf venv  # Mac/Linux
rmdir /s /q venv  # Windows (PowerShell)
```

### 2️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  
```sh
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary
```  

---

### 3️⃣ **Generate `requirements.txt`**  
```sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```  
This allows others to install the same dependencies by running:  
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

---

### 4️⃣ **GitHub & Jira Setup**  
✔ Created a **GitHub Repository**.  
✔ Set up a **Jira Project**.  
✔ Linked Jira issues with GitHub commits.  

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**  
🔹 Implement **database models** for Users.  
🔹 Create **API Endpoints** for User Registration & Authentication.  
🔹 Connect **PostgreSQL Database**.  
🔹 Implement JWT Authentication.  

---

## ⚠️ **Important Notes**  
- **DO NOT commit the `venv/` folder**.  
- Add `venv/` to `.gitignore`.  
- Commit & push `requirements.txt` to GitHub.
